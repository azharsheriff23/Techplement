Project Details :  Deploying Web Application on EC2.
Description: Deploy a web application on an Amazon EC2 instance using an appropriate programming language and web framework. Implementation: Set up an EC2 instance, install necessary software, configure security groups, and deploy the web application code. Use Elastic IP for a static IP address and Elastic Load Balancer for load balancing if required.

Primary Goal: Based on the Project Description we have decided to maintain the architecture as highly available. 
We have decided to Deploy a Shopping application

Services Used:

Virtual Private Cloud:
		The VPC places a role to maintain the services which are associated to that vpc should be highly secure within the region. 
		The Netmask of the vpc is 10.0.0.0/25
		Two Availability zones and two subnets, each Azâ€™s have one subnet
		The subnet mask are 10.0.0.0/26, 10.0.0.64/26
		We have configured the Internet gateway to main route table to publicly accessible.
EC2 Compute:
		Here we are using compute power service as elastic cloud compute and it can be associated with Auto scaling groups and load balancers.
		Auto Scaling Group is service which can automatically scale up and down the number instances by configuring the launch template.
		Load balancers are attach to the target groups where we can balance the among the instances traffic without overwhelmed a single instance.
